### String Formatting
- Multiline Strings assign by using 3 quotes ( """ or ''' )
- Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings.The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d"
  - %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
  - %d - Integers
  - %f - Floating point numbers
  - %.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.
  - %x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)

### String Operations
- Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings. ( len(), index(), )
- Slicing the string into bits
  - arr[start:stop:step]
  - slice(start,stop,step)
