# Python Learning

## 1. Variables and Types
- Introduction to Python and its role in DevOps.

 - %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
- %d - Integers
- %f - Floating point numbers
- %.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.
- %x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)
